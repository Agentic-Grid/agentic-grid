# ============================================================================
# TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES (delete this section when using)
# ============================================================================
#
# AGENT TYPES:
#   DISCOVERY  - Requirements, user stories, specifications
#   DESIGNER   - UI/UX design, visual specs, design tokens
#   DATA       - Database schema, migrations, data models
#   BACKEND    - API endpoints, services, business logic
#   FRONTEND   - React components, hooks, pages
#   DEVOPS     - Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure, scripts
#   QA         - Testing, validation, acceptance criteria
#
# STATUS VALUES:
#   pending     - Not started
#   in_progress - Currently being worked on
#   blocked     - Waiting on dependency or issue
#   qa          - Implementation complete, awaiting validation
#   completed   - Done and validated
#
# PRIORITY VALUES:
#   high   - Critical path, blocks other work
#   medium - Important but not blocking
#   low    - Nice to have, can be deferred
#
# TYPE VALUES:
#   enhancement    - New feature or capability
#   design         - Visual/UX specifications
#   schema         - Data structure definitions
#   implementation - Code implementation
#   automation     - Scripts, CI/CD, tooling
#   validation     - Testing and QA
#
# PHASE GUIDELINES:
#   Phase 1: Foundation (DISCOVERY, DESIGNER, DATA) - parallel
#   Phase 2: Core Implementation (BACKEND, FRONTEND) - parallel
#   Phase 3: Integration (multi-agent coordination) - may be parallel
#   Phase 4: Validation (QA) - sequential
#
# DEPENDENCY RULES:
#   - DESIGNER tasks should block FRONTEND tasks
#   - DATA tasks should block BACKEND tasks
#   - BACKEND tasks may block FRONTEND (when API is needed)
#   - All implementation tasks should block QA tasks
